        My main engine of development is the desire to become a specialist in my field. A specialist who will be well paid to make your dreams come true. A specialist who can work from anywhere in the world. I started my journey by studying the layout. For half a year now, I have a second job where I am engaged in site layout. When I realized that I had more or less secured the necessary initial skills, I decided to go to the next stage and ended up here.
